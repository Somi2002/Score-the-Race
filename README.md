# Score-the-Race
This C++ code calculates the score of each team in a race based on the order of their runners and determines the winning team with the lowest score. The program takes user input for each team's runner order and ensures that all teams have the same number of runners. 
It then calculates each team's score, determines the winner, and outputs the result. The code has been fixed to eliminate syntax errors and improve readability.
